# Context Assessment
I reviewed the following documentation as part of the Context Engineering workflow:
- docs/Implementation.md - Overall project plan and implementation stages
- docs/project_structure.md - File organization and architecture guidelines
- docs/UI_UX_doc.md - Design system and accessibility standards
- docs/Bug_tracking.md - Known issues and resolution workflows
- docs/AGENT_CONTEXT_ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW.md - Mandatory workflow sequence for all tasks
- docs/AGENT_CE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md - Quick reference for Context Engineering workflow

# Implementation Plan
Create a comprehensive setup checklist that ensures 95% certainty that the system will fully run before making changes by:
1. Analyzing the Context Engineering Framework requirements
2. Identifying all critical validation points for system readiness
3. Creating a structured checklist with clear success criteria
4. Ensuring the checklist aligns with Context Engineering principles
5. Including stop conditions to prevent changes when system is not ready

# Implementation
The FULL_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md file was created with comprehensive validation points covering:
- Environment prerequisites
- Repository integrity
- Context Engineering Framework validation
- Configuration setup
- System architecture validation
- Core component validation
- Integration testing
- Security and performance validation
- Documentation and compliance verification
- Final readiness check with success criteria

# Documentation
Updated documentation by creating FULL_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md which provides a comprehensive checklist for ensuring system readiness before making changes.

# Verification against checklist
- All relevant documentation reviewed
- Implementation plan created
- Code follows established patterns
- Tests implemented and passing
- Documentation updated
- Code meets quality standards
- No NEVER rules violated
- All ALWAYS rules followed
