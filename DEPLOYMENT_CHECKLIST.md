# Blackletter GDPR Processor - Production Deployment Checklist

## Overview
This checklist guides you through deploying the Blackletter GDPR Processor system to a production environment.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ System Requirements
- [ ] Server/VM with minimum 4GB RAM, 2 CPU cores, 20GB storage
- [ ] Ubuntu 20.04+ or CentOS 8+ (recommended)
- [ ] Domain name (optional but recommended)
- [ ] SSL certificate (recommended)

### ✅ Prerequisites Installation
- [ ] Docker and Docker Compose installed
- [ ] Git installed (if cloning repository)
- [ ] Firewall configured (if needed)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Obtain the Application
- [ ] Clone repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
- [ ] OR download latest release archive
- [ ] Extract files to deployment directory

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
- [ ] Copy `.env.example` to `backend/.env`
- [ ] Edit `backend/.env` with your configuration:
  - [ ] Set `SECRET_KEY` to a secure random string
  - [ ] Configure `DATABASE_URL` (if using external database)
  - [ ] Configure `REDIS_URL` (if using external Redis)
  - [ ] Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` (optional for LLM features)

### 3. Verify Configuration Files
- [ ] Check `docker-compose.final.yml` settings
- [ ] Verify port mappings (default: 3000 for frontend, 8000 for backend)
- [ ] Confirm volume mappings for data persistence

### 4. Start the Application
- [ ] Run deployment script:
  - [ ] Linux/macOS: `./start-production.sh`
  - [ ] Windows: `./start-production.ps1`
- [ ] OR run manually:
  - [ ] `docker-compose -f docker-compose.final.yml up -d`

### 5. Monitor Startup Process
- [ ] Wait 30-60 seconds for services to start
- [ ] Check container status:
  - [ ] `docker-compose -f docker-compose.final.yml ps`
- [ ] View logs if needed:
  - [ ] `docker-compose -f docker-compose.final.yml logs -f`

### 6. Verify Installation
- [ ] Check backend health:
  - [ ] `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- [ ] Check frontend health:
  - [ ] `curl http://localhost:3000/health`
- [ ] Access web interface in browser:
  - [ ] Frontend: http://localhost:3000
  - [ ] API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Post-Deployment Configuration

### ✅ Domain and SSL Setup (Recommended)
- [ ] Configure DNS to point to server IP
- [ ] Install Nginx as reverse proxy
- [ ] Obtain SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt)
- [ ] Configure HTTPS redirection

### ✅ Monitoring and Maintenance
- [ ] Set up log monitoring
- [ ] Configure backup procedures
- [ ] Implement health check monitoring
- [ ] Set up alerting for system issues

### ✅ Security Hardening
- [ ] Restrict firewall to necessary ports only
- [ ] Regularly update Docker images
- [ ] Implement automated security scanning
- [ ] Review and rotate secrets regularly

## Testing Deployment

### ✅ Basic Functionality Tests
- [ ] Upload test contract file
- [ ] Verify processing completes successfully
- [ ] Check results display correctly
- [ ] Test dashboard functionality

### ✅ Performance Tests
- [ ] Upload multiple files simultaneously
- [ ] Verify system response times
- [ ] Test with large files (approaching 10MB limit)

### ✅ Security Tests
- [ ] Test file type restrictions
- [ ] Verify size limits enforced
- [ ] Check error handling for invalid inputs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions
- [ ] **Services not starting**: Check logs with `docker-compose logs`
- [ ] **Database connection errors**: Verify DATABASE_URL in environment file
- [ ] **Frontend build failures**: Check frontend container logs
- [ ] **Performance issues**: Monitor resource usage, consider scaling

### Getting Help
- [ ] Check documentation in repository
- [ ] Review logs for error messages
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set
- [ ] Ensure all required services are running

## Completion

### ✅ Deployment Successful
- [ ] All services running without errors
- [ ] Web interface accessible
- [ ] API endpoints responding
- [ ] Basic functionality tested

### ✅ Documentation and Training
- [ ] Provide user documentation to team
- [ ] Conduct user training sessions
- [ ] Establish support procedures
- [ ] Schedule regular maintenance windows
