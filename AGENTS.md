## Agent Communication Protocol

### Context Engineering Workflow
1. **Task Assessment:** Agent evaluates task against framework requirements
2. **Business Context Analysis:** Agent analyzes business value and stakeholder needs
3. **Risk Assessment:** Agent identifies potential risks and mitigation strategies
4. **Documentation Consultation:** Agent references relevant framework documents
5. **Implementation:** Agent executes task following established patterns
6. **Quality Check:** Agent validates output against framework standards
7. **Business Value Validation:** Agent confirms alignment with business objectives
8. **Documentation Update:** Agent updates relevant documentation if needed

### Required Behaviors
- **ALWAYS** consult framework documentation before implementation
- **ALWAYS** follow established naming conventions and patterns
- **ALWAYS** implement proper error handling and logging
- **ALWAYS** ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- **ALWAYS** maintain 80%+ test coverage for new code
- **ALWAYS** analyze business context and stakeholder needs
- **ALWAYS** assess risks and document mitigation strategies
- **NEVER** bypass framework quality standards
- **NEVER** ignore accessibility requirements
- **NEVER** skip error handling implementation
- **NEVER** proceed without understanding business value

### Risk Assessment Protocol
All agents MUST follow this risk assessment protocol before implementation:

1. **Identify Technical Risks**
   - Review `docs/Risk_Management_Framework.md` for risk categories
   - Analyze potential architecture, performance, security, and data risks
   - Document identified risks with probability and impact assessments

2. **Identify Business Risks**
   - Assess value delivery and market risks
   - Evaluate compliance and stakeholder alignment risks
   - Document business risk implications

3. **Identify Operational Risks**
   - Review deployment and maintenance considerations
   - Assess team and process risks
   - Document operational risk factors

4. **Define Mitigation Strategies**
   - Select appropriate mitigation approaches (avoid, transfer, mitigate, accept)
   - Create action plans for high-priority risks
   - Assign risk ownership and monitoring responsibilities

5. **Document Risk Assessments**
   - Record all risk assessments in the risk register
   - Update risk dashboard with current risk status
   - Communicate critical risks to stakeholders immediately

### Risk Mitigation Requirements
- **Critical Risks:** Must be addressed before implementation begins
- **High Risks:** Must have mitigation plans in place before implementation
- **Medium Risks:** Should be monitored with periodic review
- **Low Risks:** Can be accepted with documentation

### Risk Communication
- Report critical risks immediately to team leads
- Document all risks in project tracking system
- Include risk updates in project status reports
- Engage stakeholders in risk mitigation decisions
