- **start-production.ps1**: PowerShell script for Windows deployment
- **docker-compose.final.yml**: Production Docker Compose configuration

## Deployment Options

### 1. Docker Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# Using the provided scripts
./start-production.sh        # Linux/macOS
./start-production.ps1       # Windows
```

### 2. Manual Installation
Follow the detailed instructions in `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **RAM**: 4GB
- **CPU**: 2 cores
- **Storage**: 20GB
- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04+, CentOS 8+, or Windows Server 2019+

### Recommended Requirements
- **RAM**: 8GB
- **CPU**: 4 cores
- **Storage**: 50GB SSD
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

## Accessing the System

Once deployed, the system will be available at:
- **Frontend**: http://your-domain.com or http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://your-domain.com/api or http://localhost:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://your-domain.com/docs or http://localhost:8000/docs

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- **Backend**: `/api/health` endpoint
- **Frontend**: `/health` endpoint

### Log Monitoring
- Docker: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.final.yml logs -f`
- Manual: System journal or log files

### Backup Procedures
- Database: `pg_dump` for PostgreSQL
- Files: Standard file backup procedures

## Scaling Options

### Horizontal Scaling
- Add more Celery workers for increased processing capacity
- Use load balancer for multiple frontend instances

### Vertical Scaling
- Increase container resources in docker-compose configuration
- Upgrade server hardware for better performance

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Keep secrets secure and never commit to version control
2. **Firewall**: Restrict access to only necessary ports
3. **Updates**: Regularly update Docker images and dependencies
4. **Backups**: Implement regular automated backup procedures
5. **SSL**: Use HTTPS in production with valid SSL certificates

## Support and Maintenance

For ongoing support:
1. Monitor system logs for errors
2. Regularly update dependencies
3. Perform periodic backups
4. Review and update documentation
5. Gather user feedback for improvements

## Conclusion

The Blackletter GDPR Processor system is production-ready and has been thoroughly tested and documented. The system provides automated detection of GDPR Article 28(3) processor obligations in contracts, with a user-friendly interface and robust backend processing.

All necessary components for deployment are included in this repository, and the system can be deployed using either Docker (recommended) or manual installation methods.

The development team has completed all required tasks and the system is ready for your production deployment.
