## Remaining Requirements for Full E2E Testing

### External Dependencies to Install
1. **Redis Server** (for job queue)
2. **PostgreSQL** (for database)
3. **Docker** (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Environment Configuration
1. **Backend Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Create backend/.env file with:
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-for-jwt-signing
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here  # Optional for LLM features
   ```

2. **Frontend Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # frontend/.env.local already exists with:
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

## How to Complete Full End-to-End Testing

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Install Docker Desktop
# 2. Start all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.final.yml up -d

# 3. Wait for services to start (30-60 seconds)
# 4. Access application at http://localhost:3000
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# 1. Install Redis and PostgreSQL
# 2. Start Redis server
redis-server

# 3. Start PostgreSQL
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start

# 4. Start backend (in backend directory)
uvicorn main:app --reload

# 5. Start Celery workers (if using)
celery -A workers.celery_app worker --loglevel=info

# 6. Start frontend (in frontend directory)
npm run dev

# 7. Access application at http://localhost:3000
```

## Testing Scenarios to Verify

### Scenario 1: Contract Upload and Analysis
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Upload Contract" 
3. Select a PDF/Text contract file
4. Verify upload progress shows
5. Wait for analysis completion
6. Verify results show GDPR compliance findings
7. Check confidence scores are displayed
8. Verify recommendations are provided

### Scenario 2: Dashboard Review
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard
2. Verify API health indicator shows "OK"
3. Check KPI cards display data
4. Test filter functionality
5. Verify search functionality works
6. Test GDPR focus toggle
7. Verify charts render correctly
8. Check issue table shows detailed findings

### Scenario 3: System Responsiveness
1. Test dark/light mode toggle
2. Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
3. Check loading states during operations
4. Verify error messages display appropriately
5. Test navigation between pages

## Success Criteria

✅ **Technical Requirements**:
- All services running without errors
- Frontend accessible at http://localhost:3000
- Backend API accessible at http://localhost:8000
- Document upload workflow completes successfully

✅ **User Experience Requirements**:
- Contract upload works end-to-end
- Dashboard displays meaningful data
- All navigation works smoothly
- Error handling is user-friendly
- Responsive design works on different devices

✅ **Functional Requirements**:
- GDPR Article 28(3) obligations detected
- Confidence scores provided for each finding
- Recommendations provided for each issue
- Search and filtering work correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   - Redis Server
   - PostgreSQL
   - Docker (optional)

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Set up backend/.env with required values
   - Verify frontend/.env.local configuration

3. **Run Full System**:
   - Start all services using either Docker or manual setup
   - Test all user scenarios
   - Verify system performance and reliability

4. **Document Results**:
   - Record test results and any issues found
   - Prepare final deployment documentation
   - Create user guide for production use

The Blackletter GDPR Processor system is ready for full end-to-end testing once the required external dependencies are installed and configured.
