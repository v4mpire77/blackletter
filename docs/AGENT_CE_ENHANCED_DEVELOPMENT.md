- ❌ **🆕 Ignore GitLens context** without understanding recent changes

### QUALITY VIOLATIONS
- ❌ **Skip testing** - All code must be testable
- ❌ **Ignore types** - Full type safety required
- ❌ **Skip documentation** - Comprehensive docs mandatory
- ❌ **Ignore errors** - Proper error handling required
- ❌ **Skip security** - Security validation mandatory
- ❌ **🆕 Ignore GitLens patterns** - Must align with recent changes
