# Blackletter Full-Stack Agent Orchestration Guide

## Purpose
Provides a high-level sequence for coordinating Blackletter's AI agents. Each step references existing project documentation so the orchestrator can shard context to the appropriate agent.

## Workflow Sequence
1. **Start Orchestrator**
   - Initialize context and determine task scope.
2. **Development Agent**
   - Reference: docs/Development_Agent_Workflow.md
   - Responsibilities: code generation, framework compliance, tests.
3. **RAG Analysis Agent**
   - Reference: docs/RAG_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
   - Responsibilities: document ingestion, vector store updates.
4. **Compliance Agent**
   - Reference: rules/ and docs/Risk_Management_Framework.md
   - Responsibilities: GDPR and legal checks.
5. **Quality Assurance Agent**
   - Reference: docs/FRAMEWORK_CHECKLIST.md
   - Responsibilities: testing and coverage validation.
6. **End Orchestrator**
   - Aggregate outputs and prepare results for stakeholders.

## Sharding Notes
- Each agent operates on a distinct documentation shard for efficient retrieval.
- Maintain small, focused documents to keep embeddings precise.
- Orchestrator must pass only the relevant shard to each agent.
