# Context Engineering Prompt: DEBUGGING

## üéØ Purpose
This prompt ensures that ALL debugging and troubleshooting tasks follow the Context Engineering Framework, enabling systematic problem-solving and preventing recurring issues.

## üìã Required Context

### MANDATORY Documentation Review
- ‚úÖ **Implementation Plan** (`docs/Implementation.md`) - Feature requirements and architecture
- ‚úÖ **Project Structure** (`docs/project_structure.md`) - Code organization and dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Development Workflow** (`docs/Development_Agent_Workflow.md`) - Quality standards
- ‚úÖ **Bug Tracking** (`docs/Bug_tracking.md`) - Issue patterns and known problems
- ‚úÖ **Security Audit Report** (`docs/SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md`) - Security requirements

### MANDATORY Codebase Context
- ‚úÖ **Current Implementation** - Understand the failing system
- ‚úÖ **Architectural Patterns** - Know established design patterns
- ‚úÖ **Component Dependencies** - Understand component relationships
- ‚úÖ **API Endpoints** - Know service patterns and requirements
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling** - Understand existing error management

## üîß Task Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Context Assessment (MANDATORY)
1. **Review Implementation Plan** - Understand feature requirements and architecture
2. **Examine Project Structure** - Identify affected components and dependencies
3. **Check Development Workflow** - Ensure debugging follows established processes
4. **Analyze Bug Tracking** - Check for known issues and patterns
5. **Review Security Requirements** - Ensure debugging doesn't compromise security

### Step 2: Problem Investigation
1. **Error Analysis** - Understand the specific error or issue
2. **Context Gathering** - Collect relevant logs, stack traces, and data
3. **Reproduction Steps** - Document steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Impact Assessment** - Determine scope and severity of the problem
5. **Root Cause Analysis** - Identify underlying causes, not just symptoms

### Step 3: Solution Development
1. **Pattern Analysis** - Check for similar issues in the codebase
2. **Solution Research** - Investigate best practices and solutions
3. **Implementation Planning** - Plan the fix following established patterns
4. **Testing Strategy** - Plan how to test the solution
5. **Rollback Planning** - Plan how to revert if the fix fails

### Step 4: Implementation and Validation
1. **Fix Implementation** - Implement the solution following standards
2. **Testing Execution** - Test the fix thoroughly
3. **Documentation Update** - Update relevant documentation
4. **Knowledge Sharing** - Document lessons learned for future reference
5. **Prevention Planning** - Plan how to prevent similar issues

## ‚úÖ Quality Standards

### Debugging Quality
- **Systematic Approach** - Follow logical problem-solving steps
- **Root Cause Focus** - Address underlying causes, not symptoms
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Test fixes thoroughly before deployment
- **Documentation** - Document problems, solutions, and lessons learned
- **Prevention** - Implement measures to prevent similar issues

### Solution Quality
- **Pattern Consistency** - Follow established architectural patterns
- **Error Handling** - Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- **Performance** - Ensure fixes don't degrade performance
- **Security** - Maintain security standards during debugging
- **Maintainability** - Ensure fixes are maintainable and understandable

### Process Quality
- **Methodical Investigation** - Follow systematic debugging process
- **Evidence-Based** - Base solutions on evidence and analysis
- **Collaborative** - Involve relevant team members when appropriate
- **Timely** - Address issues promptly to minimize impact
- **Learning** - Extract lessons learned for continuous improvement

## üö´ Prohibited Actions

### WITHOUT PROPER CONTEXT
- ‚ùå **Debug issues** without understanding the system
- ‚ùå **Implement fixes** without knowing architecture
- ‚ùå **Skip testing** without understanding requirements
- ‚ùå **Ignore patterns** without understanding established practices
- ‚ùå **Compromise security** during debugging process

### DEBUGGING VIOLATIONS
- ‚ùå **Quick fixes** - Must address root causes
- ‚ùå **Incomplete testing** - Must test thoroughly
- ‚ùå **Poor documentation** - Must document problems and solutions
- ‚ùå **Pattern violations** - Must follow established patterns
- ‚ùå **Security compromises** - Must maintain security standards
