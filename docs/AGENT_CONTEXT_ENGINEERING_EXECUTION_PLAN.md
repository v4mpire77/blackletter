# Agent Context Engineering Execution Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the execution plan for implementing the Context Engineering Framework across all agent types in the Blackletter Systems project. It provides detailed procedures for ensuring 95%+ certainty that the system will fully run before making changes.

## Pre-Task Execution Procedures

### 1. Tool Validation
Before any task execution, validate all Context Engineering tools:
```bash
# Test all tools
python tools/test_tools.py

# Verify automation tool
python tools/context_engineering_automation.py "Test task" --project-root .

# Verify validator tool
python tools/context_engineering_validator.py sample_response.txt --json
```

### 2. Context Generation
For every task, generate a context summary:
```bash
python tools/context_engineering_automation.py "Task description" --project-root .
```

### 3. Workflow Template Creation
Generate workflow templates for complex tasks:
```bash
python tools/context_engineering_automation.py "Task description" --template --project-root .
```

## Task Execution Process

### Mandatory Workflow Sequence
All agents MUST follow this exact sequence for every task:

1. **Context Assessment**
   - Review all relevant documentation
   - Generate context summary for complex tasks
   - Identify dependencies and prerequisites

2. **Implementation Plan**
   - Create detailed implementation plan
   - Identify required resources
   - Plan testing strategy

3. **Implementation**
   - Follow established patterns and architecture
   - Write quality, testable code
   - Include proper error handling

4. **Documentation**
   - Update code documentation
   - Update relevant documentation files
   - Maintain changelog entries

5. **Verification**
   - Validate against quality standards
   - Check Context Engineering compliance
   - Run tests and confirm functionality

## Quality Assurance Requirements

### Testing Standards
- **Minimum Coverage:** 80% for all new code
- **Test Types:** Unit, integration, and edge case testing
- **Documentation:** All public APIs and functions must be documented
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for frontend components

### Performance Standards
- **API Response Time:** < 2 seconds for standard requests
- **File Processing:** Support up to 10MB document uploads
- **Memory Usage:** Efficient resource utilization
- **Database Queries:** Optimized with proper indexing

### Security Standards
- **Input Validation:** All user inputs must be validated
- **Authentication:** Required for all protected endpoints
- **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **API Keys:** Never hardcode secrets in source code

## Framework Compliance Validation

### Required Validation Checks
- **Score Requirement:** 80%+ on Context Engineering validator
- **Documentation References:** All 4 core documentation files must be referenced
- **NEVER Rules:** No violations of critical prohibitions
- **ALWAYS Rules:** High compliance with mandatory requirements

### Validation Commands
```bash
# Validate agent response
python tools/context_engineering_validator.py response_file.txt --json

# Generate context summary
python tools/context_engineering_automation.py "Task description" --project-root .

# Test tools functionality
python tools/test_tools.py
```

## Agent-Specific Procedures

### Development Agent Workflow
1. Consult `docs/Development_Agent_Workflow.md` before implementation
2. Follow established naming conventions and patterns
3. Maintain 80%+ test coverage for all new code
4. Update `docs/Implementation.md` and `docs/project_structure.md` as needed

### RAG Analysis Agent Integration
1. Process documents according to `docs/RAG_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`
2. Update vector storage with new embeddings
3. Optimize performance based on usage patterns
4. Validate compliance with framework standards

### Compliance Agent Execution
1. Review all legal documents against `rules/` directory
2. Generate compliance reports for GDPR and other regulations
3. Document risk assessments and findings
4. Update compliance documentation as needed

### Quality Assurance Agent Monitoring
1. Execute automated testing suites regularly
2. Analyze code coverage reports
3. Benchmark performance against established targets
4. Scan for security vulnerabilities

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Common Issues and Solutions
1. **Tool Import Errors:** Verify Python path and dependencies
2. **Validation Failures:** Check documentation references and workflow compliance
3. **Performance Degradation:** Monitor resource usage and optimize queries
4. **Security Vulnerabilities:** Implement proper input validation and encryption

### Rollback Procedures
1. Version control all changes with semantic versioning
2. Maintain backup copies of critical files
3. Document rollback steps for each major change
4. Test rollback procedures regularly

## Continuous Improvement

### Regular Reviews
- Monthly framework compliance validation
- Quarterly performance benchmarking
- Annual tool suite updates
- Continuous monitoring and optimization

### Feedback Integration
- Collect agent performance metrics
- Analyze validation results and trends
- Update procedures based on lessons learned
- Share best practices across agent types
