# Context Engineering Prompt: DEVELOPMENT

## üéØ Purpose
This prompt ensures that ALL development tasks follow the Context Engineering Framework, preventing code quality issues and maintaining architectural consistency.

## üìã Required Context

### MANDATORY Documentation Review
- ‚úÖ **Implementation Plan** (`docs/Implementation.md`) - Feature placement and architecture
- ‚úÖ **Project Structure** (`docs/project_structure.md`) - Code organization and file locations
- ‚úÖ **UI/UX Guidelines** (`docs/UI_UX_doc.md`) - Design system and component standards
- ‚úÖ **Development Workflow** (`docs/Development_Agent_Workflow.md`) - Process and quality standards
- ‚úÖ **Bug Tracking** (`docs/Bug_tracking.md`) - Issue prevention and resolution

### MANDATORY Codebase Context
- ‚úÖ **Current Architecture** - Understand existing patterns and structure
- ‚úÖ **Component Library** - Use existing components and utilities
- ‚úÖ **API Endpoints** - Follow established service patterns
- ‚úÖ **Database Schema** - Maintain data consistency
- ‚úÖ **Security Requirements** - Follow security guidelines

## üîß Task Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Context Assessment (MANDATORY)
1. **Review Implementation Plan** - Understand feature's architectural placement
2. **Examine Project Structure** - Identify correct file locations and patterns
3. **Check UI/UX Guidelines** - Ensure design system compliance
4. **Review Development Workflow** - Follow established processes
5. **Analyze Bug Tracking** - Prevent known issues

### Step 2: Implementation Planning
1. **Architecture Review** - Ensure solution fits existing patterns
2. **Component Selection** - Use existing components where possible
3. **API Design** - Follow established endpoint patterns
4. **Data Flow** - Maintain consistent data handling
5. **Error Handling** - Implement proper error boundaries

### Step 3: Code Implementation
1. **Follow Naming Conventions** - Use established patterns
2. **Implement Type Safety** - Full TypeScript/Python type coverage
3. **Add Error Handling** - Comprehensive error management
4. **Include Documentation** - Proper docstrings and comments
5. **Follow Security Guidelines** - Authentication and validation

### Step 4: Quality Assurance
1. **Code Review** - Self-review against framework standards
2. **Testing Implementation** - Unit and integration tests
3. **Documentation Update** - Update relevant documentation
4. **Performance Check** - Verify performance requirements
5. **Security Validation** - Ensure security compliance

## ‚úÖ Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- **Test Coverage:** Minimum 80% for new code
- **Type Safety:** 100% TypeScript/Python type coverage
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive docstrings and comments
- **Error Handling:** Proper error boundaries and user feedback
- **Performance:** Meet performance benchmarks

### Architecture Compliance
- **Pattern Consistency:** Follow established architectural patterns
- **Component Reuse:** Use existing components where possible
- **Service Integration:** Follow established service patterns
- **Data Consistency:** Maintain database and API consistency
- **Security Standards:** Follow security guidelines

### User Experience
- **Design System Compliance:** Follow UI/UX guidelines
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach
- **Performance:** Sub-2 second response times
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages

## üö´ Prohibited Actions

### WITHOUT PROPER CONTEXT
- ‚ùå **Implement features** without reviewing Implementation Plan
- ‚ùå **Place code** without understanding Project Structure
- ‚ùå **Create UI** without following Design System
- ‚ùå **Write APIs** without understanding service patterns
- ‚ùå **Handle data** without understanding schema
- ‚ùå **Deploy changes** without security review

### QUALITY VIOLATIONS
- ‚ùå **Skip testing** - All code must be testable
- ‚ùå **Ignore types** - Full type safety required
- ‚ùå **Skip documentation** - Comprehensive docs mandatory
- ‚ùå **Ignore errors** - Proper error handling required
- ‚ùå **Skip security** - Security validation mandatory
