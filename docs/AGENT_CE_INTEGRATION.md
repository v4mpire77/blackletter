# Context Engineering Prompt: INTEGRATION

## üéØ Purpose
This prompt ensures that ALL integration and deployment tasks follow the Context Engineering Framework, maintaining system stability and preventing deployment failures.

## üìã Required Context

### MANDATORY Documentation Review
- ‚úÖ **Implementation Plan** (`docs/Implementation.md`) - System architecture and requirements
- ‚úÖ **Project Structure** (`docs/project_structure.md`) - Code organization and dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Development Workflow** (`docs/Development_Agent_Workflow.md`) - Quality standards
- ‚úÖ **Security Audit Report** (`docs/SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md`) - Security requirements
- ‚úÖ **Deployment Guide** (`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`) - Deployment processes and procedures

### MANDATORY Codebase Context
- ‚úÖ **Current Implementation** - Understand the system being deployed
- ‚úÖ **Architectural Patterns** - Know established design patterns
- ‚úÖ **Component Dependencies** - Understand component relationships
- ‚úÖ **API Endpoints** - Know service patterns and requirements
- ‚úÖ **Configuration Management** - Understand environment-specific settings

## üîß Task Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Context Assessment (MANDATORY)
1. **Review Implementation Plan** - Understand system architecture and requirements
2. **Examine Project Structure** - Identify deployment components and dependencies
3. **Check Development Workflow** - Ensure deployment follows established processes
4. **Review Security Requirements** - Ensure deployment maintains security standards
5. **Analyze Deployment Guide** - Follow established deployment procedures

### Step 2: Deployment Planning
1. **Environment Analysis** - Understand target environment requirements
2. **Dependency Mapping** - Identify all required dependencies and services
3. **Configuration Planning** - Plan environment-specific configurations
4. **Rollback Strategy** - Plan how to revert if deployment fails
5. **Testing Strategy** - Plan how to validate deployment success

### Step 3: Pre-Deployment Validation
1. **Code Quality Check** - Verify code meets quality standards
2. **Security Validation** - Ensure security requirements are met
3. **Dependency Verification** - Verify all dependencies are available
4. **Configuration Validation** - Validate environment configurations
5. **Testing Execution** - Run pre-deployment tests

### Step 4: Deployment Execution
1. **Environment Preparation** - Prepare target environment
2. **Dependency Installation** - Install required dependencies
3. **Configuration Deployment** - Deploy environment configurations
4. **Application Deployment** - Deploy the application
5. **Health Check Validation** - Verify deployment success

### Step 5: Post-Deployment Validation
1. **Functionality Testing** - Test deployed functionality
2. **Performance Validation** - Verify performance requirements
3. **Security Verification** - Confirm security standards maintained
4. **Monitoring Setup** - Ensure proper monitoring and alerting
5. **Documentation Update** - Update deployment documentation

## ‚úÖ Quality Standards

### Deployment Quality
- **Reliability** - Deployments must be reliable and repeatable
- **Security** - Maintain security standards throughout deployment
- **Performance** - Ensure performance requirements are met
- **Monitoring** - Proper monitoring and alerting must be in place
- **Documentation** - All deployment steps must be documented

### Integration Quality
- **Compatibility** - Ensure compatibility with existing systems
- **Dependency Management** - Proper dependency versioning and management
- **Configuration Management** - Environment-specific configuration handling
- **Error Handling** - Proper error handling and rollback procedures
- **Scalability** - Ensure deployment supports future growth

### Process Quality
- **Methodical Approach** - Follow systematic deployment process
- **Testing** - Comprehensive testing at each stage
- **Validation** - Verify success at each deployment step
- **Rollback** - Ability to quickly revert failed deployments
- **Learning** - Document lessons learned for continuous improvement

## üö´ Prohibited Actions

### WITHOUT PROPER CONTEXT
- ‚ùå **Deploy systems** without understanding architecture
- ‚ùå **Configure environments** without knowing requirements
- ‚ùå **Skip testing** without understanding test requirements
- ‚ùå **Ignore security** without understanding security requirements
- ‚ùå **Deploy without rollback** without understanding risks

### INTEGRATION VIOLATIONS
- ‚ùå **Unplanned deployments** - Must follow deployment plan
- ‚ùå **Incomplete testing** - Must test thoroughly
- ‚ùå **Poor documentation** - Must document all steps
- ‚ùå **Security compromises** - Must maintain security standards
- ‚ùå **No rollback plan** - Must have rollback strategy

## üìö Required Documentation

- [ ] Testing strategy planned and documented

### After Deployment
- [ ] Deployment successfully completed and validated
- [ ] Functionality tested and verified
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Security standards maintained
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured

## üîç Validation Checklist

### Context Validation

## üö® ENFORCEMENT

### Mandatory Compliance
- **NO EXCEPTIONS** - Every integration task must follow this prompt
- **NO BYPASSES** - Context Engineering cannot be skipped
- **NO ALTERNATIVES** - This is the only approved integration process

### Violation Consequences
1. **First Violation** - Immediate task termination and restart
2. **Second Violation** - Mandatory Context Engineering training
3. **Persistent Violations** - Integration access revoked

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ All required context reviewed and understood
- ‚úÖ Deployment thoroughly planned and validated
- ‚úÖ All requirements met and verified
- ‚úÖ Security standards maintained
