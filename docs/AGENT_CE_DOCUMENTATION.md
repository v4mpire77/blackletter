# Context Engineering Prompt: DOCUMENTATION

## üéØ Purpose
This prompt ensures that ALL documentation and planning tasks follow the Context Engineering Framework, maintaining consistency and quality across all project documentation.

## üìã Required Context

### MANDATORY Documentation Review
- ‚úÖ **Implementation Plan** (`docs/Implementation.md`) - Project scope and architecture
- ‚úÖ **Project Structure** (`docs/project_structure.md`) - Code organization and patterns
- ‚úÖ **UI/UX Guidelines** (`docs/UI_UX_doc.md`) - Design system and standards
- ‚úÖ **Development Workflow** (`docs/Development_Agent_Workflow.md`) - Process standards
- ‚úÖ **Context Engineering Framework** (`docs/AGENT_CE_ENFORCEMENT.md`) - Framework requirements

### MANDATORY Codebase Context
- ‚úÖ **Current Implementation** - Understand existing features and code
- ‚úÖ **Architectural Patterns** - Know established design patterns
- ‚úÖ **Component Library** - Understand existing components and utilities
- ‚úÖ **API Documentation** - Know service patterns and requirements
- ‚úÖ **User Flows** - Understand user experience and workflows

## üîß Task Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Context Assessment (MANDATORY)
1. **Review Implementation Plan** - Understand project scope and requirements
2. **Examine Project Structure** - Verify documentation organization and placement
3. **Check UI/UX Guidelines** - Ensure design system compliance
4. **Review Development Workflow** - Follow established documentation processes
5. **Analyze Framework Requirements** - Ensure Context Engineering compliance

### Step 2: Documentation Planning
1. **Purpose Definition** - Clearly define documentation purpose and audience
2. **Structure Planning** - Plan logical organization and flow
3. **Content Outline** - Create comprehensive content outline
4. **Integration Planning** - Plan how documentation fits existing structure
5. **Quality Planning** - Plan quality assurance and review process

### Step 3: Content Creation
1. **Follow Templates** - Use established documentation templates
2. **Maintain Consistency** - Follow naming conventions and formatting
3. **Include Examples** - Provide practical examples and use cases
4. **Cross-Reference** - Link to related documentation and resources
5. **User-Centric** - Focus on user needs and understanding

### Step 4: Quality Assurance
1. **Content Review** - Self-review against framework standards
2. **Accuracy Verification** - Verify technical accuracy and completeness
3. **Usability Testing** - Ensure documentation is clear and actionable
4. **Integration Check** - Verify proper integration with existing docs
5. **Accessibility Review** - Ensure documentation is accessible

## üö´ Prohibited Actions

### WITHOUT PROPER CONTEXT
- ‚ùå **Create documentation** without understanding requirements
- ‚ùå **Place content** without knowing documentation structure
- ‚ùå **Write technical content** without understanding implementation
- ‚ùå **Ignore user needs** without understanding audience
- ‚ùå **Skip quality review** without following standards

### DOCUMENTATION VIOLATIONS
- ‚ùå **Incomplete content** - Must be comprehensive
- ‚ùå **Inaccurate information** - Must be technically correct
- ‚ùå **Poor organization** - Must be logically structured
- ‚ùå **Missing examples** - Must include practical examples
- ‚ùå **No cross-references** - Must link to related resources
