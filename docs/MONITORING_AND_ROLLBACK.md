# Monitoring and Rollback Procedures

## Overview

This document defines the monitoring and rollback procedures for the Blackletter Systems Context Engineering Framework. It ensures continuous system health monitoring and provides clear rollback procedures to maintain 95%+ certainty that the system will fully run.

## Real-time Monitoring

### Health Check Endpoints
All services must implement health check endpoints:

1. **Backend API Health Check**
   - Endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/health`
   - Response: JSON with service status
   - Monitoring: Continuous ping every 30 seconds

2. **Frontend Application Health Check**
   - Endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/health`
   - Response: HTTP 200 OK for healthy state
   - Monitoring: Continuous ping every minute

3. **Database Health Check**
   - Endpoint: Database connection test
   - Response: Connection success/failure
   - Monitoring: Continuous check every 30 seconds

4. **Redis Health Check**
   - Endpoint: Redis ping command
   - Response: PONG for healthy state
   - Monitoring: Continuous check every 30 seconds

## Rollback Procedures

### Version Control Strategy
- **Semantic Versioning:** MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format
- **Git Tags:** All releases tagged with version numbers
- **Branch Strategy:** 
  - `main` branch for production releases
  - `develop` branch for integration
  - Feature branches for individual developments

### Automated Rollback Triggers
Rollback automatically initiated when:
- [ ] Health check failures for > 5 minutes
- [ ] Error rate > 10% for 10 consecutive minutes
- [ ] Performance degradation > 50% for 5 minutes
- [ ] Security incident detected
- [ ] Data integrity issues identified

### Manual Rollback Process

#### Step 1: Identify Rollback Target
1. Determine the last stable version
2. Verify the version is available in version control
3. Confirm rollback is necessary and appropriate

#### Step 2: Prepare for Rollback
1. Notify stakeholders of planned rollback
2. Document current system state
3. Backup current database (if data changes occurred)
4. Prepare rollback scripts and procedures

#### Step 3: Execute Rollback
1. Stop all services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. Checkout previous stable version:
   ```bash
   git checkout v1.2.3  # Replace with actual version tag
   ```

3. Restore previous configuration:
   ```bash
   # Restore .env file if needed
   cp .env.backup .env
   ```

4. Start services with previous version:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

#### Step 4: Validate Rollback
1. Verify all services are running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

2. Test core functionality:
   - Access frontend application
   - Test backend API endpoints
   - Verify database connectivity
   - Check Redis connectivity

3. Monitor system performance:
   - Response times
   - Error rates
   - Resource usage

#### Step 5: Document and Communicate
