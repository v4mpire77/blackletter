# Context Engineering Prompt: REVIEW

## üéØ Purpose
This prompt ensures that ALL code review and analysis tasks follow the Context Engineering Framework, maintaining code quality and architectural consistency.

## üìã Required Context

### MANDATORY Documentation Review
- ‚úÖ **Implementation Plan** (`docs/Implementation.md`) - Feature requirements and architecture
- ‚úÖ **Project Structure** (`docs/project_structure.md`) - Code organization standards
- ‚úÖ **Development Workflow** (`docs/Development_Agent_Workflow.md`) - Quality standards
- ‚úÖ **Bug Tracking** (`docs/Bug_tracking.md`) - Issue patterns and prevention
- ‚úÖ **Security Audit Report** (`docs/SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md`) - Security requirements

### MANDATORY Codebase Context
- ‚úÖ **Current Implementation** - Understand what's being reviewed
- ‚úÖ **Architectural Patterns** - Know established design patterns
- ‚úÖ **Component Library** - Understand existing components
- ‚úÖ **API Standards** - Know service patterns and requirements
- ‚úÖ **Testing Standards** - Understand test coverage requirements

## üîß Task Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Context Assessment (MANDATORY)
1. **Review Implementation Plan** - Understand feature requirements
2. **Examine Project Structure** - Verify code placement and organization
3. **Check Development Workflow** - Ensure quality standards compliance
4. **Analyze Bug Tracking** - Identify potential issues
5. **Review Security Requirements** - Check security compliance

### Step 2: Code Analysis
1. **Architecture Review** - Verify pattern consistency
2. **Component Analysis** - Check component usage and design
3. **API Review** - Validate endpoint design and patterns
4. **Data Flow Analysis** - Check data handling consistency
5. **Security Validation** - Verify security implementation

### Step 3: Quality Assessment
1. **Code Quality** - Check readability and maintainability
2. **Test Coverage** - Verify testing implementation
3. **Documentation** - Check code documentation quality
4. **Performance** - Assess performance implications
5. **Error Handling** - Verify error management

### Step 4: Feedback and Recommendations
1. **Issue Identification** - Document specific problems
2. **Solution Suggestions** - Provide actionable improvements
3. **Pattern Recommendations** - Suggest architectural improvements
4. **Security Enhancements** - Recommend security improvements
5. **Performance Optimizations** - Suggest performance improvements

## ‚úÖ Quality Standards

### Review Quality
- **Comprehensive Analysis** - Cover all aspects of the code
- **Actionable Feedback** - Provide specific, implementable suggestions
- **Pattern Consistency** - Ensure architectural consistency
- **Security Focus** - Prioritize security considerations
- **Performance Awareness** - Consider performance implications

### Code Quality Standards
- **Test Coverage:** Minimum 80% for all code
- **Type Safety:** 100% TypeScript/Python type coverage
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive and accurate
- **Error Handling:** Proper error boundaries and user feedback
- **Security:** Follow security guidelines and best practices

### Architecture Standards
- **Pattern Consistency:** Follow established architectural patterns
- **Component Reuse:** Utilize existing components appropriately
- **Service Integration:** Follow established service patterns
- **Data Consistency:** Maintain database and API consistency
- **Scalability:** Consider future growth and maintenance

## üö´ Prohibited Actions

### WITHOUT PROPER CONTEXT
- ‚ùå **Review code** without understanding requirements
- ‚ùå **Suggest changes** without knowing architecture
- ‚ùå **Recommend patterns** without understanding context
- ‚ùå **Ignore security** without security review
- ‚ùå **Skip testing** without understanding test requirements

### REVIEW VIOLATIONS
- ‚ùå **Superficial review** - Must be comprehensive
- ‚ùå **Vague feedback** - Must be specific and actionable
- ‚ùå **Ignore patterns** - Must maintain consistency
- ‚ùå **Skip security** - Security review mandatory
- ‚ùå **Ignore performance** - Performance consideration required
