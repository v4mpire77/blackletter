## Recently Resolved Issues

### BUG-002: Supabase Build-Time Initialization Errors
**Date Reported:** 2025-01-24
**Reporter:** Omar
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Status:** Resolved

### Description
Next.js build process was failing due to Supabase client initialization during build time when environment variables were not available. This prevented deployment to Render.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Run `npm run build` in frontend directory
2. Build fails with "supabaseUrl is required" errors
3. Multiple pages fail prerendering due to Supabase dependency

### Expected Behavior
Build should complete successfully and generate static pages for deployment.

### Actual Behavior
Build failed with Supabase configuration errors, preventing deployment.

### Environment
- **OS:** Windows 10
- **Frontend Version:** Next.js 14.0.4
- **Supabase:** @supabase/supabase-js v2.39.0
- **Build Target:** Render deployment platform

### Error Messages
```
Error: supabaseUrl is required.
Error occurred prerendering page "/dashboard"
Error occurred prerendering page "/upload"
Error occurred prerendering page "/login"
```

### Root Cause
Two Supabase client files (`frontend/lib/supabase.ts` and `frontend/lib/supabaseClient.ts`) were both trying to initialize the Supabase client immediately during build time, before environment variables were available.

### Resolution
1. **Fixed `frontend/lib/supabase.ts`:**
   - Added conditional client initialization: `typeof window !== 'undefined'`
   - Wrapped client creation in try-catch blocks
   - Made `createSupabaseClient()` function safe for server-side rendering

2. **Fixed `frontend/lib/supabaseClient.ts`:**
   - Added conditional initialization check
   - Created `getSupabaseClient()` function for safe access
   - Prevented immediate client creation during build

3. **Updated `frontend/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`:**
   - Added client-side only initialization check
   - Wrapped Supabase operations in try-catch blocks
   - Made authentication functions resilient to missing Supabase

4. **Updated components to use dynamic imports:**
   - Added `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false` to Supabase-dependent pages
   - Updated dashboard, upload, and login pages

### Files Modified
- `frontend/lib/supabase.ts`
- `frontend/lib/supabaseClient.ts`
- `frontend/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- `frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `frontend/app/upload/page.tsx`
- `frontend/app/login/page.tsx`

### Testing
- **Build Test:** ✅ `npm run build` now completes successfully
- **Type Check:** ✅ `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with no errors
- **Page Generation:** ✅ All 9 pages generate successfully
- **Supabase Errors:** ✅ No more build-time Supabase initialization errors

### Prevention
- Always use conditional initialization for client-side only libraries
- Wrap environment variable access in safety checks
- Use `next/dynamic` for components that require client-side APIs
- Test builds in CI/CD pipeline before deployment

### Related Issues
- Render deployment failures
- Frontend build process issues

### BUG-003: Frontend Layout Issues - Unwanted Left Column
**Date Reported:** 2025-01-24
**Reporter:** Omar
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Status:** Resolved

### Description
Deployed application was displaying an unwanted left column/sidebar that was not part of the intended layout design.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Deploy application to Render
2. View deployed application
3. Notice unwanted left column taking up screen space

### Expected Behavior
Clean, centered layout without unwanted columns or sidebars.

### Actual Behavior
Application displays with an unwanted left column, affecting user experience and layout.

### Environment
- **Platform:** Render deployment
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 with Tailwind CSS
- **Layout:** App router with custom CSS

### Root Cause
CSS conflicts between custom `.container` classes and Tailwind CSS's built-in container utilities, potentially causing layout issues.

### Resolution
1. **Fixed CSS Container Conflicts:**
   - Renamed custom `.container` CSS to `.layout-container` in `frontend/app/globals.css`
   - Prevented conflicts with Tailwind's container utilities

2. **Added Layout Safety Measures:**
   - Added `overflow-x: hidden` to prevent horizontal scroll
   - Implemented `box-sizing: border-box` for all elements
   - Added flex container fixes to prevent overflows

3. **Enhanced CSS Structure:**
   - Added debugging utilities (commented out)
   - Improved layout container management
   - Added responsive design safeguards

### Files Modified
- `frontend/app/globals.css`

### Testing
- **Build Test:** ✅ Build completes successfully with new CSS
- **Layout Safety:** ✅ Added overflow and box-sizing protections
- **CSS Conflicts:** ✅ Resolved container class conflicts

### Prevention
- Use unique class names to avoid conflicts with framework CSS
- Test layouts across different screen sizes
- Implement CSS reset and normalization
- Use CSS debugging tools to identify layout issues

### Related Issues
- Production layout problems
- CSS framework conflicts
2. Try to access navigation menu

- Browser: Safari, Chrome
- Frontend Version: 1.0.0

**Root Cause:** Missing click handlers for mobile menu items.

**Resolution:** Pending

**Files Modified:** `frontend/components/navigation.tsx`
