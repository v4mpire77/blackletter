### For Developers

#### Code Security
```python
# Example: Secure input validation
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator
import re

class DocumentUpload(BaseModel):
    filename: str
    content_type: str
    
    @validator('filename')
    def validate_filename(cls, v):
        if not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$', v):
            raise ValueError('Invalid filename')
        return v
    
    @validator('content_type')
    def validate_content_type(cls, v):
        allowed_types = ['application/pdf']
        if v not in allowed_types:
            raise ValueError('Unsupported file type')
        return v
```

#### Authentication
```python
# Example: Secure JWT handling
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import jwt
from passlib.context import CryptContext

pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")

def create_access_token(data: dict, expires_delta: timedelta = None):
    to_encode = data.copy()
    if expires_delta:
        expire = datetime.utcnow() + expires_delta
    else:
        expire = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=15)
    to_encode.update({"exp": expire})
    encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(to_encode, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=ALGORITHM)
    return encoded_jwt
```

### For System Administrators

#### Environment Security
```bash
# Example: Secure environment configuration
# Use environment variables for sensitive data
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost/db"
export SECRET_KEY="your-secure-secret-key"
export JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret"

# Regular security updates
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
