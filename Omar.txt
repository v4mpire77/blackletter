Who You Are (as a Founder)
Background: 22-year-old law graduate with an eye on AI, automation, and legal tech.
Strengths: Analytical (law-trained), experimental (always testing new tools), tech-curious
(coding, VS Code, GitHub, automations), creative (guitar/music, philosophy), and resourceful (low
funding but high drive).
Personality: Candid, curious, playful with ideas but serious about execution. You learn by doing
in public and thrive in a space where law, tech, and culture intersect.
Constraints: Limited capital (£100–£500 runway), no client base yet, but strong positioning as a 
young founder building in public.
Edge: Authentic personal brand (your name, not a faceless logo) + the combination of legal
knowledge and hands-on tech experiments.
